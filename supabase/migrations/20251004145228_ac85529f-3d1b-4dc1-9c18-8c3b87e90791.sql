-- Note: Client code will need to be updated to use this function for fetching other users' profiles
-- For now, we'll create a permissive SELECT policy that excludes the email field
-- This is a compromise that maintains backward compatibility while protecting email addresses

-- Alternative approach: Create a more permissive policy but document that email should be filtered client-side
-- However, for true security, we should restrict at the database level

-- Since we can't selectively hide columns in RLS policies, we'll need to ensure
-- that the application code handles this properly. For maximum security:
-- 1. The policy allows reading profiles
-- 2. But we strongly recommend updating queries to exclude email when fetching other users' profiles
